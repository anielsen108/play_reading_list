     Serious + Playful | Serious + Not Playful
     ——————————————————+————————————————————————
     Frivolous + Playful | Neither
     ```
   - Examples for each quadrant
   - Where does most of your time go?

2. **Discussion (8 min):** Breakout rooms of 3-4
   - What makes play "serious"?
   - What makes seriousness "playful"?
   - Kam's definition insights

3. **Synthesis (2 min):** Full group themes

## Exercise 2: Outcome Attachment Test (30 minutes)

### Concept
Serious play involves engagement without outcome attachment

### Activity
1. **High Stakes Activity (10 min):** Everyone does same task
   - Make it matter, track score, compare performance
   - Notice internal pressure, comparison, anxiety

2. **Serious Play Version (10 min):** Same activity
   - Full engagement but outcome doesn't matter
   - Track progress for curiosity, not comparison
   - Notice different quality of attention

3. **Reflection (10 min):** Breakout rooms of 3
   - How did attachment to outcome change experience?
   - Can you be serious without attachment?
   - This is Kam's "serious play"

### Key Insight
Seriousness ≠ outcome attachment

   - Approach 2 (6 min): Practice playfully (curious exploration)
   - Notice difference

2. **Discussion (10 min):** Breakout rooms of 3-4
   - Which led to better learning?
   - Which was more sustainable?
   - Can mastery be pursued playfully?
   - What does Kam mean by serious play?

3. **Application (3 min):** Full group

## Exercise 4: The Commitment Paradox (20 minutes)

### Concept
Serious play requires commitment without attachment

### Activity
1. **Paradox Exploration (15 min):** Breakout rooms of 3
   - How can you be committed yet playful?
   - Isn't play defined by non-commitment?
   - What's the difference between:
     - Serious play (Kam)

     - Serious work
   - Resolve the paradox

2. **Synthesis (5 min):** Full group shares solutions

   - Where do you pursue mastery without attachment?
   - When do you take something seriously but lightly?

2. **Sharing (12 min):** Breakout rooms of 3-4
   - Share examples
   - Common patterns?
