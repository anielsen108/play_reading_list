# Zoom Exercise Ideas: What Is Play? How Children Define It

**Reference:** [What Is Play? How Children Define It - Peter Gray](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-learn/202205/what-is-play-how-children-define-it)
**Topic:** Children's own definition and experience of play
**Duration:** 9 minutes reading time

## Core Themes
- Children know what play is even if adults struggle to define it
- Play is self-chosen and self-directed
- Adult-controlled activities ≠ play (even if "play-based")
- Teacher control undermines play's benefits
- Children's agency is essential to play
- Distinction between play-like activities and true play

## Exercise 1: Adult vs. Child Definitions (25 minutes)

### Concept
Compare how adults vs. children define play to expose our projections

### Activity
1. **Adult Definitions (8 min):** Individual then full group
   - Each person writes their definition of play (2 min)
   - Share in chat or verbally
   - Facilitator notes common themes on whiteboard
   - Notice: How theoretical/abstract are our definitions?

2. **Children's Definitions (5 min):** Facilitator presents Gray's findings
   - Children focus on freedom, choice, fun
   - Simple, experiential definitions
   - "You get to do what you want"
   - "Nobody tells you what to do"

3. **Comparison Analysis (10 min):** Breakout rooms of 3-4
   - How do adult and child definitions differ?
   - What do adults add that children don't mention?
   - What do children emphasize that adults overlook?
   - Why the divergence?

4. **Synthesis (2 min):** Full group
   - Which definition is more useful?
   - What does the difference reveal about adult relationship to play?

### Discussion Questions
- Do adults intellectualize play to avoid the vulnerability of actually playing?
- Why do children have such clarity about play?
- What did we lose when we grew up?

## Exercise 2: Self-Chosen vs. Imposed Activity (30 minutes)

### Concept
Experience the difference between self-chosen and adult-directed "play"

### Activity
1. **Round 1: Adult-Directed "Play" (8 min):**
   - Facilitator assigns everyone a "playful" activity
   - Example: "Everyone must draw a funny picture for 3 minutes"
   - Or: "Let's play a game" (specific rules, required participation)
   - Notice your internal experience
   - Required participation

2. **Reflection (3 min):** Individual, cameras off
   - Did that feel like play?
   - What was your internal experience?
   - Resistance? Obligation? Joy? Resentment?

3. **Round 2: True Choice (8 min):**
   - Facilitator: "For the next 3 minutes, do whatever you want. Play, don't play, whatever."
   - Complete freedom
   - Can leave camera on or off
   - Can engage or not
   - Notice your internal experience

4. **Comparison Discussion (10 min):** Breakout rooms of 3
   - How did the two rounds feel different?
   - Which was actually "play"?
   - What does this teach about Gray's argument?
   - How does this apply to children's "play-based" programs?

5. **Debrief (1 min):** Full group insights

### Key Insight
The feeling of choice is essential to play, regardless of the activity's content

## Exercise 3: Play vs. Play-Like Matrix (35 minutes)

### Concept
Distinguish between true play and play-like activities that adults mislabel

### Activity
1. **Category Creation (5 min):** Facilitator presents Gray's framework:
   - **True Play:** Self-chosen, self-directed, intrinsically motivated
   - **Play-Like:** Adult-directed, even if fun/game-based, extrinsically motivated

2. **Activity Sorting (15 min):** Breakout rooms of 4
   - Create list of childhood activities
   - Sort into True Play vs. Play-Like
   - Gray's test: "Can the child stop without adult consequences?"
   - Examples to debate:
     - Youth soccer (organized)
     - Kicking ball with friends
     - "Play-based" preschool
     - Recess with adult supervision and rules
     - Video games
     - "Educational" games
   - Document reasoning in shared doc

3. **Gray Zone Discussion (10 min):** Return to full group
   - Where did groups disagree?
   - What activities are ambiguous?
   - Does context matter? (same activity, different control levels)
   - Present findings

4. **Application (5 min):**
   - What activities that adults call "play" actually aren't?
   - What's the harm in mislabeling?
   - How do we create more true play?

### Critical Thinking
Many "play-based" educational programs aren't actually play by children's definitions

---

## Exercise 4: Agency Audit (30 minutes)

### Concept
Children emphasize agency as core to play. Examine agency in various contexts.

### Activity
1. **Agency Spectrum (10 min):** Individual work
   - List activities from your childhood
   - Rate each for level of agency (1-10 scale)
     - 1 = Zero agency (completely controlled)
     - 10 = Complete agency (total self-direction)
   - Notice: Where did true play fall on spectrum?

2. **Pattern Analysis (15 min):** Breakout rooms of 3-4
   - Share your agency ratings
   - Questions to explore:
     - What level of agency is required for something to feel like play?
     - Can partial agency be play?
     - How much adult presence is compatible with play?
     - What about safety requirements?
   - Document findings

3. **Modern Application (5 min):** Full group
   - How much agency do children have today?
   - What forces reduce agency?
   - What would it take to restore it?

### Key Questions
- Is agency binary or spectrum?
- Can play exist under any adult direction?
- What's the minimum threshold for play to feel real?

---

## Exercise 5: Teacher Control Undermining Play (35 minutes)

### Concept
Examine Gray's claim that teacher control destroys play's benefits, even in "play-based" programs

### Activity
1. **Scenario Analysis (15 min):** Divide into 3 breakout groups, each analyzes a scenario:
   - **Scenario 1:** "Play-based" learning where teacher guides all play toward learning objectives
   - **Scenario 2:** Recess with adult-enforced rules, conflict resolution, and structured activities
   - **Scenario 3:** "Free play" time with teacher observation and intervention
   - Each group discusses:
     - Is this play by Gray's definition?
     - What are intentions vs. reality?
     - What gets lost when teachers control?
     - What's gained?

2. **Presentations (9 min):** Each group presents (3 min each)

3. **Educator's Dilemma (8 min):** Full group
   - If you're an educator, how do you reconcile:
     - Need to keep children safe
     - Educational responsibilities
     - Play's need for child-direction
   - Is there a way forward?
   - What would Gray recommend?

4. **Synthesis (3 min):**
   - When is adult involvement helpful vs. harmful?
   - Can teachers create play contexts without controlling play itself?

### For Educators
This may be challenging—hold space for the difficulty

## Exercise 6: Fun vs. Play Distinction (25 minutes)

### Concept
Not all fun is play, and not all play is fun. Examine this distinction.

### Activity
1. **Category Examples (10 min):** Breakout rooms of 3
   - Brainstorm examples for each quadrant:
     ```
     Fun + Play | Fun + Not Play
     ———————————+————————————————
     Not Fun +  | Not Fun +
     Play       | Not Play
     ```
   - Examples:
     - Fun + Play: Pick-up basketball with friends
     - Fun + Not Play: Rollercoaster (passive, pre-determined)
     - Not Fun + Play: Challenging yourself at hard puzzle
     - Not Fun + Not Play: Mandatory boring task
   - Populate all quadrants

2. **Analysis (12 min):** Return to full group
   - Share examples from each quadrant
   - Facilitator maps on whiteboard
   - Discussion:
     - Is fun essential to play?
     - Can something be play if it's challenging/frustrating?
     - What differentiates categories?

3. **Gray's Definition (3 min):**
   - Children don't define play as "fun"
   - They define it by agency and choice
   - Fun may or may not be present

### Key Insight
We confuse entertainment (fun) with play (agency)

---

## Exercise 7: The Voluntariness Test (20 minutes)

### Concept
Gray's key test: "Can the child stop without consequences?"

### Activity
1. **Test Application (12 min):** Breakout rooms of 4
   - List modern childhood activities
   - Apply voluntariness test to each:
     - Can child stop without adult disappointment?
     - Can child stop without peer judgment?
     - Can child stop without losing status/access?
     - Can child stop without consequences?
   - Rate each activity for true voluntariness

2. **Findings (6 min):** Return to full group
   - How many activities pass the test?
   - What fails that we might have thought was play?
   - What passes that we might have overlooked?

3. **Reflection (2 min):**
   - How much of childhood is truly voluntary?
   - What would change if we made more activities voluntary?

### Discussion
- Is some degree of non-voluntariness necessary (school, etc.)?
- Can we increase voluntariness within necessary structures?
- What's the cost of compulsion, even in "playful" activities?

---

## Exercise 8: Adults "Doing Less" Practice (30 minutes)

### Concept
Gray suggests adults should "do less" to enable play. Practice this restraint.

### Activity
1. **Intervention Inventory (8 min):** Individual reflection
   - Think of a recent interaction with a child (or imagine one)
   - List all your interventions:
     - Suggestions
     - Redirections
     - Questions
     - Safety warnings
     - Teaching moments
     - Conflict resolutions
   - Be honest about control impulses

2. **Restraint Practice (12 min):** Breakout rooms of 3
   - Role play scenarios:
     - Person A: "Child" playing
     - Person B: Adult practicing restraint
     - Person C: Observer
   - Scenarios:
     - Child building something "wrong"
     - Children having conflict
     - Child bored
     - Child choosing "inappropriate" play
   - Adult practices not intervening
   - Observer notes adult's struggle
   - Rotate roles

3. **Reflection (8 min):** Full group
   - How hard was it to not intervene?
   - What impulses arose?
   - What did the "child" experience?
   - What got lost/gained when adult held back?

4. **Commitment (2 min):**
   - One intervention you'll restrain this week

### Key Learning
Adult restraint is difficult but essential for true play

## Exercise 9: Play-Based Marketing Critique (30 minutes)

### Concept
Critically examine "play-based" educational marketing through Gray's lens

### Activity
1. **Materials Gathering (5 min):**
   - Facilitator shares examples of "play-based" program marketing
   - Or participants share programs they know
   - Schools, apps, toys, curricula

2. **Critical Analysis (18 min):** Breakout rooms of 4
   - Analyze marketing claims through Gray's framework:
     - Who's in control: child or adult/program?
     - Is it self-directed or guided toward outcomes?
     - Can child opt out?
     - What's the real purpose: play or learning?
     - Is this play or play-washing?
   - Rate programs for actual playfulness
   - Document findings in shared doc

3. **Presentations (5 min):** Quick shares from groups
   - Which programs are authentic?
   - Which are appropriating "play" for marketing?
   - How can parents/educators tell the difference?

4. **Framework Creation (2 min):**
   - Create quick checklist for evaluating "play-based" claims

### Consumer Education
Help participants see through play-washing marketing

## Exercise 10: Designing for True Play (40 minutes)

### Concept
If we accept children's definition of play, what would we design differently?

### Activity
1. **Context Assignment (5 min):** Divide into 4 breakout groups:
   - Group 1: Design a school day
   - Group 2: Design a playground
   - Group 3: Design an after-school program
   - Group 4: Design a summer camp

2. **Design Sprint (25 min):** In breakout rooms
   - Redesign your assigned context honoring Gray's principles:
     - Maximum child agency
     - Minimum adult control
     - Voluntary participation
     - Self-direction
   - Address safety concerns without sacrificing play
   - Create concrete, specific proposals
   - Use shared doc to collaborate

3. **Presentations (8 min):** Each group presents (2 min)

4. **Feasibility Discussion (2 min):**
   - What barriers would these designs face?
   - What would need to change to implement them?

### Outcome
Move from critique to creative solutions

---

## Facilitator Notes

### Preparation
- Read Gray's article carefully, noting children's actual quotes
- Prepare examples of "play-based" marketing to critique
- Consider your own childhood and relationship to play
- Be ready for educators to feel defensive

### Managing Educator Defensiveness
- Many educators will feel attacked
- Acknowledge good intentions
- Distinguish critique of system from critique of individuals
- Focus on structural constraints
- Offer pathways forward, not just criticism

### Balancing Idealism and Pragmatism
- Gray's vision may seem impossible in current system
- Hold both the ideal and the practical
- Small changes matter
- Some contexts allow more true play than others

### Connection to Reading List
- Builds on Gray's first essay (Play Deficit)
- Provides operational definition of play
- Sets up Winnicott's theoretical framework
- Challenges adult assumptions throughout list
- Provides concrete criteria for evaluating play

## Extended Reflection Questions

For journaling between sessions:

1. What did you think play was before reading Gray? What do you think now?
2. When did you last experience self-chosen, self-directed activity?
3. If you work with children, how much true play do they actually get?
4. What would you have to give up to allow more child agency?
5. How do children's definitions of play challenge your assumptions?
6. Can adults experience true play, by this definition?

## Variations for Different Groups

**Educators/Teachers:**
- Focus heavily on classroom applications
- Discuss realistic ways to increase child agency
- Share success stories (free schools, forest schools, etc.)
- Problem-solve specific constraints

**Parents:**
- Apply to home life and activity choices
- Discuss extracurricular decisions
- Examine family routines
- Create support for resisting over-scheduling

**Researchers/Academics:**
- Deeper dive into definitional questions
- Examine research on play definitions

---

## Follow-Up Activities

**Immediate Actions:**
- Observe one hour of children's activity through Gray's lens
- Note: Is it truly play? Who's in control?
- If you work with children: Reduce one adult intervention
- Track your impulses to control/direct

**Before Next Session:**
- Ask a child to define play (if you have access)
- Compare their definition to your own
- Try experiencing fully self-directed activity yourself
- Notice where you lack agency in your own life

**Suggested Pairings:**
- Read immediately after "The Play Deficit" for continuity
- Follow with Winnicott for psychological depth
- Connect to phenomenology section (what play feels like)
- Link to Graeber (philosophical vs. operational definitions)

**Practical Application:**
- Use Gray's framework to audit children's schedules
- Identify true play vs. play-like activities
- Eliminate or reduce one play-like activity
- Add space for true play
- Form community of practice to support this shift
