- Modern culture's bias toward sincerity over ritual
- Value of ritual action independent of internal states
- Ritual creates community and meaning through shared practice

## Exercise 1: Ritual vs. Sincere Experience (30 minutes)

### Concept
Directly experience the difference between ritual and sincere modes

### Activity
1. **Sincere Mode (8 min):** Breakout rooms of 3
   - Share something meaningful only if you feel genuinely moved
   - Must be authentic, from the heart
   - No performance, only true feeling
   - Notice: pressure, waiting for right feeling, self-monitoring

2. **Ritual Mode (8 min):** Return to main room, new breakout rooms
   - Everyone performs same ritual action regardless of feeling:
     - Go around circle, each person says "I appreciate [name]"
     - Bow or gesture to each person
     - Follow form whether you feel it or not
   - Notice: ease, rhythm, shared experience

3. **Comparison (12 min):** Return to full group
   - Which mode felt better?
   - Which created more connection?
   - Which was more stressful?
   - What surprised you?
   - Chapman: Ritual may be more reliable for connection

4. **Discussion (2 min):**
   - When is sincerity important? When is ritual?

### Key Insight
Ritual creates connection through shared form, independent of internal states

---

## Exercise 2: Ritual Without Belief (25 minutes)

### Concept
Explore whether ritual "works" even without sincere belief

### Activity
1. **Ritual Creation (5 min):** Full group creates simple ritual:
   - Example: Start each Zoom by lighting candle, stating intention, ringing bell
   - Design specific actions, order, words

2. **Skeptical Performance (10 min):**
   - Perform ritual together
   - You don't have to believe in it
   - Just do the actions
   - Notice what happens

3. **Reflection (10 min):** Breakout rooms of 3-4
   - Did the ritual do anything despite skepticism?
   - Create atmosphere? Connection? Transition?
   - Does belief matter as much as we think?
   - Chapman's point: Ritual works through form, not faith

### Discussion
- Why does modern culture insist on belief?
- What do we lose by dismissing "empty" rituals?

## Exercise 3: Play as Ritual (30 minutes)

### Concept
Examine how play functions ritually

### Activity
1. **Play Ritual Identification (10 min):** Breakout rooms of 4
   - What rituals exist in play?
     - Game opening/closing
     - Turn-taking forms
     - Repeated phrases ("ready or not, here I come")
     - Boundary markers (base, home, safe zones)
   - Are these "sincere" or "ritual"?
   - Document examples

2. **Function Analysis (15 min):** Continue in breakout rooms
   - What do play rituals accomplish?
   - Create magic circle/play space?
   - Enable trust?
   - Mark transitions?
   - Could play work without these rituals?

3. **Synthesis (5 min):** Full group
   - Share insights
   - Connect to Chapman's framework
   - Is play more ritual or sincere mode?

### Key Learning
Play relies heavily on ritual structure, not internal sincerity

## Exercise 4: The Sincerity Burden (35 minutes)

### Concept
Experience the exhaustion of constant sincerity requirements

### Activity
1. **Sincerity Requirements (12 min):** Full group
   - For next 10 minutes: Only speak if genuinely, authentically moved
   - Must monitor internal states constantly
   - Nothing performed or habitual
   - Notice: silence, self-consciousness, exhaustion

2. **Relief Through Form (8 min):**
   - Switch to structured turn-taking
   - Each person must speak when it's their turn
   - Can use formula: "Something I notice is..."
   - Don't worry about authenticity
   - Notice: ease, flow, less pressure

3. **Analysis (12 min):** Breakout rooms of 3
   - Which was more exhausting?
   - Which produced more actual communication?
   - Chapman's critique: Sincerity culture is tyrannical
   - What's the cost of constant authenticity demands?

## Exercise 6: Form vs. Feeling Spectrum (30 minutes)

### Concept
Map activities on spectrum from pure ritual to pure sincerity

### Activity
1. **Spectrum Creation (5 min):** Facilitator shares screen:
   ```
   Pure Ritual ←——————————————→ Pure Sincerity
   (Form matters,      Both      (Feeling matters,
    feeling doesn't)              form doesn't)
   ```

2. **Activity Mapping (15 min):** Breakout rooms of 3-4
   - Plot various activities on spectrum:
     - Wedding ceremony
     - Greeting someone
     - Expressing gratitude
     - Playing a game
     - Prayer
     - Making art
     - Having conversation

     - Next person adds to it
     - Build iteratively
     - Must involve everyone
     - Must be doable on Zoom
   - Example: Gesture → sound → word → movement → repeat
   - Practice it together 3 times

2. **Reflection (12 min):** Breakout rooms of 3
   - How did creating ritual together feel?
   - How did performing it feel?
   - Did it create something? What?
   - Was anyone's sincerity required?
   - What did the form alone accomplish?

3. **Synthesis (3 min):** Full group

## Exercise 8: Mentalist Autopsy (25 minutes)

### Concept
Examine how mentalism/internalization dominates modern life

### Activity
1. **Mentalist Inventory (10 min):** Individual reflection
   - Where are you required to have "right" internal states?
   - Examples:

   - Activities that currently demand sincerity
   - Examples: gratitude, apology, celebration, greeting

2. **Ritual Redesign (18 min):** Breakout rooms of 4
   - Choose one activity
   - Redesign as ritual rather than sincere expression:
     - What's the form?
     - What exact actions/words?
     - When/how performed?
     - Who participates?
     - Does feeling matter?
   - Create specific ritual structure

3. **Presentations (5 min):** Groups share designs

4. **Reflection (2 min):** Full group
   - Would ritual version be better or worse?
   - What would we gain/lose?

### Example
Instead of "say thanks when you feel grateful" → daily gratitude circle with form, regardless of feeling

## Exercise 10: Play as Ritual Mode (35 minutes)

### Concept
Understand play through ritual lens (vs. sincere/expressive lens)

### Activity
1. **Two Play Approaches (16 min):**
   - **Round 1 - Sincere Play (8 min):** Breakout rooms of 3
     - "Play together, but only if you genuinely feel playful"
     - Wait for authentic impulse
     - Don't force it
     - Notice: awkwardness, waiting, self-monitoring

   - **Round 2 - Ritual Play (8 min):** New breakout rooms
     - "We're going to play this game now, ready or not"
     - Follow form regardless of feeling
     - Just do the actions
     - Notice: ease, momentum, emergence

2. **Comparison (15 min):** Return to full group, then breakout rooms of 4
   - Which approach actually produced more play?
   - Which felt better?
   - Does playfulness require feeling playful?
   - Or does ritual form create playfulness?
   - Chapman: Ritual enables states, not vice versa

3. **Application (4 min):** Full group
   - How to support play ritually?
   - What rituals enable play?
   - Stop waiting for playful feelings?

### Key Insight
Ritual play forms may create playfulness more reliably than demanding playful feelings
