## Exercise 1: Three Ages of Play (40 minutes)

### Concept
Understand play through premodern, modern, postmodern, and metamodern lenses

### Activity
1. **Framework Presentation (10 min):** Facilitator explains:
   - **Premodern:** Play as ritual, sacred, communal
   - **Modern:** Play as development, learning, productive
   - **Postmodern:** Play as ironic, subversive, meaningless
   - **Metamodern:** Play as meaning-making, participatory, integrative

2. **Era Exploration (20 min):** Breakout rooms by era (4 groups)
   - Each explores play from their assigned perspective
   - What is play for?
   - What does it enable?
   - What are limits of this view?
   - Prepare 3-minute presentation

3. **Dialogue (10 min):** Representatives from each era discuss
   - What does each perspective offer?
   - What does each miss?
   - How might metamodern integrate them?

### Key Question
Can we recover premodern depth without losing modern/postmodern insights?

## Exercise 2: Participatory Knowing Through Play (35 minutes)

### Concept
Vervaeke emphasizes play as participatory knowing, not just propositional

### Activity
1. **Three Ways of Knowing (15 min):**
   - **Propositional (5 min):** Learn facts about something (lecture-style)
   - **Procedural (5 min):** Learn how to do something (follow instructions)
   - **Participatory (5 min):** Play with something (no instructions, just engage)
   - Same subject, three approaches

2. **Comparison (15 min):** Breakout rooms of 3-4
   - Which kind of knowing felt different?
   - What did each reveal?
   - Which involved play?
   - Vervaeke: Play is participatory knowing
   - What does this mean?
   - How is this different from just "learning"?

3. **Application (5 min):** Full group
   - Where do we overemphasize propositional knowing?
   - How to increase participatory knowing?
   - What role does play have?

### Key Insight
Play is a way of knowing, not just doing

### Concept
Explore Vervaeke's concept of "optimal grip" in play context

### Activity

2. **Grip Experiments (15 min):**
   - **Too Tight (5 min):** Over-control an activity, micro-manage
   - **Too Loose (5 min):** Completely hands-off, disengaged
   - **Optimal (5 min):** Playful engagement, responsive
   - Notice how each feels

3. **Discussion (10 min):** Breakout rooms of 3
   - When did you find optimal grip?
   - How does play help calibrate grip?
   - Where in life is your grip off?
   - What would playful adjustment look like?

### Application
Play as practice for right relationship to reality

2. **Play vs. Flow (20 min):** Breakout rooms of 4
   - Compare flow and play:
     - Similarities?
     - Differences?
     - Can you have one without the other?
     - Flow without play? (grinding work)
     - Play without flow? (frustrated play)
   - What's the relationship?
   - Vervaeke: Both involve optimal grip

3. **Cultivation (7 min):** Return to full group
   - How to create conditions for flow-play?
   - What prevents it?
