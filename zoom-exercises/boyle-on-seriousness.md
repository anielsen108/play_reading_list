   - Share one thing from each list
   - Patterns: What's socially acceptable to be serious about?
   - What invites mockery or cynicism?
   - How does irony function as social protection?

3. **Cultural Mapping (5 min):** Return to main room
   - Facilitator creates two columns on whiteboard:
     - "Acceptable Seriousness" | "Requires Ironic Distance"
   - Group populates with examples
   - Notice patterns: family, career, hobbies, politics, spirituality, etc.

### Discussion Questions

## Exercise 2: The Irony Trap Experience (30 minutes)

### Concept
Feel what it's like to be unable to escape ironic framing

### Activity
1. **Earnest Sharing Setup (2 min):** Facilitator explains:
   - You'll each share something you care deeply about
   - Others must respond with irony/cynicism only
   - Notice how this feels

2. **Round Robin Irony (15 min):** Full group, cameras on
   - Person shares something they're passionate about (1 min)
   - Next 2-3 people respond with ironic/dismissive comments
   - Person who shared: notice your felt reaction
   - Rotate through 4-5 people

3. **Contrast Experience (8 min):**
   - Same format, but responses must be earnest and serious
   - Notice how this feels different

4. **Debrief (5 min):**
   - How did ironic responses affect you?
   - How did earnest responses feel?
   - What does Boyle's essay help us understand about this?
   - Is American culture stuck in the first mode?

3. **Synthesis Exploration (10 min):** Breakout rooms of 4 (mixed teams)
   - Is there a both/and solution?
   - Examples of serious play?
   - Can you be seriously committed to playfulness?
   - What would Graeber say about Boyle? Boyle about Graeber?

4. **Resolution Attempt (5 min):** Full group
   - Is the tension real or apparent?
