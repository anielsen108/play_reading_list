---

## Exercise 1: Silent Play Observation & Reflection (20 minutes)

### Setup
- Have all participants watch the Red Pandas video together via screen share
- Instruct everyone to turn off their cameras and mute themselves
- Watch in complete silence

### Activity
1. **First Viewing (2 min):** Watch without any prompt, just observe
2. **Reflection Period (5 min):** Participants privately write down:
   - What emotions arose while watching?
   - What did you notice about the pandas' movements?
   - When was the last time you played like this?
3. **Second Viewing (2 min):** Watch again, this time focusing on specific movements
4. **Group Share (10 min):** Cameras on, popcorn style sharing of observations
5. **Synthesis (1 min):** Facilitator highlights common themes

### Zoom Features
- Screen share for synchronized viewing
- Breakout rooms optional for smaller reflection groups
- Chat for those who prefer written responses

## Exercise 2: Mirroring Play Movement (15 minutes)

### Setup
- All participants cameras on
- Gallery view enabled
- Clear space behind chairs for movement

### Activity
1. **Watch & Notice (2 min):** Play the red panda video and have participants note specific movements
2. **Individual Exploration (3 min):** Each person tries to embody one red panda movement they noticed
   - Rolling
   - Pawing at air
   - Tumbling
   - Investigating objects playfully
3. **Partner Mirroring (8 min):** In breakout rooms of 2-3:
   - Person A performs their red panda movement
   - Person B mirrors it back
   - Discuss: How did it feel to move this way?
   - Switch roles
4. **Full Group Debrief (2 min):** What did we learn about play through our bodies?

### Discussion Prompts
- How does physical play differ from mental play?
- What obstacles prevented you from fully embodying playful movement?
- How does watching play affect us differently than engaging in it?

## Exercise 3: Purposeless Activity Design (30 minutes)

### Concept
Red pandas play without goal or purpose. Can we design an activity for our Zoom group that is equally purposeless?

### Activity
1. **Brainstorm (10 min):** In breakout groups, design a 3-minute "purposeless activity" that could happen on Zoom
   - Must have no productive outcome
   - Should involve multiple people
   - Can use Zoom features creatively
   - Examples: synchronized random movements, making faces, creating nonsense sounds

2. **Performance (15 min):** Each group leads the full meeting in their purposeless activity

3. **Reflection (5 min):**
   - How did it feel to do something without purpose?
   - What resistance arose?
   - Did joy emerge?

### Key Learning
Examining our cultural discomfort with purposelessness and the relationship between play and productivity

## Exercise 4: Play Narrative Deconstruction (25 minutes)

### Setup
- Facilitator prepares the video to be played on mute

### Activity
1. **Silent Viewing (2 min):** Watch red pandas on mute
2. **Narrative Overlay (10 min):** Breakout groups discuss:
   - If we HAD to assign purpose to the pandas' play, what would we say?
   - What adult narratives do we project onto purposeless activity?
   - How does our culture interpret animal play (training, survival skills, etc.)?
3. **Creative Exercise (8 min):** Each group writes two versions of a nature documentary voiceover:
   - Version A: "Serious" scientific explanation
   - Version B: Honoring pure play with no purpose
4. **Share & Compare (5 min):** Perform voiceovers for the group

### Discussion Questions
- Why do we feel compelled to make play purposeful?
- How does this relate to Graeber's essay on play as fundamental principle?
- What would change if we accepted purposelessness?

---

## Exercise 5: Personal Play Archaeology (20 minutes)

### Inspired By
The red pandas' unselfconscious play reminds us of childhood play before socialization

### Activity
1. **Individual Reflection (7 min):** Turn cameras off and reflect:
   - Describe a moment of pure play from your childhood
   - What were you doing?
   - Who was watching (or not watching)?
   - When did you stop playing like that?

2. **Gallery Share (10 min):** Turn cameras on
   - Each person shares their memory in 60 seconds
   - No cross-talk, just witnessing

3. **Pattern Recognition (3 min):** Facilitator or participants identify:
   - Common themes in when/how play stopped
   - Social forces that ended pure play
   - What we lost

### Zoom Adaptation
- Use "Raise Hand" feature to manage sharing order
- Optional: Create a shared Google Doc where people can write their memories
- Breakout rooms for more intimate sharing in smaller groups

## Exercise 6: Play Interruption Experiment (15 minutes)

### Concept
Explore what happens when we interrupt purposeful Zoom behavior with play

### Setup
- Begin with a "normal" Zoom activity (mock presentation, meeting, etc.)
- Secretly designate 2-3 "play instigators"

### Activity
1. **Normal Meeting (3 min):** Start a mundane Zoom discussion
2. **Play Interruptions (7 min):** Instigators randomly:
   - Make red panda movements
   - Use silly filters/backgrounds
   - Interrupt with playful sounds
   - See how group responds
3. **Group Awareness (2 min):** Reveal the experiment
4. **Debrief (3 min):**
   - How did the group react to play interrupting "work"?
   - What social pressures emerged?
   - Who played along vs. who resisted?

### Key Insights
Understanding the social enforcement of seriousness and how play is policed in group settings

## Exercise 7: Technology as Play Space (25 minutes)

### Concept
Can Zoom itself become a playground like the pandas' environment?

### Activity
1. **Feature Exploration (5 min):** Identify Zoom features that could be used playfully:
   - Virtual backgrounds (rapid changing)
   - Filters and effects
   - Reactions (spam all at once)
   - Gallery view rearrangement
   - Audio/video on/off patterns
   - Annotations on screen share

2. **Play Choreography (12 min):** Breakout groups create a 2-minute "Zoom play performance"
   - Must use at least 3 Zoom features
   - Must involve synchronization or call-and-response
   - Should serve no purpose except joy

3. **Performance & Witness (8 min):** Groups perform for each other

### Discussion
- How does technology constrain or enable play?
- Did the digital medium enhance or limit playfulness?
- What's different about digital vs. physical play?

## Facilitator Notes

### Preparation
- Test all video playback before session
- Have multiple ways to share video ready (URL, screen share, etc.)
- Prepare examples of purposeless activities in case groups get stuck

### Managing Resistance
- Many adults will feel uncomfortable with purposeless activity
- Acknowledge this discomfort directly
- Create explicit permission for silliness
- Model playfulness as facilitator

### Accessibility Considerations
- Not everyone can move physically—offer alternative participation
- Provide camera-off options while maintaining engagement
- Offer chat/written alternatives for sharing
- Be mindful of cultural differences in comfort with play

### Connection to Reading List
- Links directly to Graeber's essay on play as fundamental principle
- Provides embodied experience before intellectual discussion
- Sets foundation for understanding play vs. purpose tension throughout the reading list

## Extended Reflection Questions

For post-session journaling or discussion:

1. What made the red pandas' play "pure" in a way that human play often isn't?
2. How does watching animal play affect your understanding of human play?
3. What would it mean to bring "red panda energy" to your daily work on Zoom?
4. If play is purposeless, why does it feel so necessary?
5. How has digital communication platforms like Zoom changed our relationship to play?
6. What permissions do animals have that adults don't?

## Variations for Different Group Sizes

**Small Groups (3-5 people):**
- Skip breakout rooms
- Do all exercises as full group
- Allow more time for individual sharing

**Medium Groups (6-15 people):**
- Use exercises as written
- Vary breakout room sizes
- Create consistent pairs for repeated exercises

**Large Groups (15+ people):**
- Extend breakout room time
- Limit full-group shares to key insights only
- Consider multiple facilitators
- Use polling features for quick group consensus

---

## Follow-up Activities

**Between Sessions:**
- Watch other animal play videos and note differences
- Try one "red panda moment" each day—pure purposeless play
- Notice when you police play in yourself or others
- Document what makes play feel "legitimate" or "illegitimate"

**For Next Session:**
- Bring one example of purposeless play you witnessed or engaged in
- Prepare a 30-second story of when someone told you to "stop playing around"
- Notice what Graeber's essay adds to your understanding of what you observed
