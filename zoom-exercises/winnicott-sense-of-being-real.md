## Exercise 1: Being vs. Doing Distinction (25 minutes)

### Concept
Experience Winnicott's distinction between "sense of being" and "sense of doing"

### Activity
1. **Doing Mode (5 min):** Full group, cameras on
   - Facilitator assigns tasks: "Make a list of 10 things, solve this puzzle, draw this shape"
   - Rush through productive activities
   - Notice your internal state

2. **Being Mode (5 min):** Cameras optional
   - Stop all doing
   - Just be present
   - No accomplishment, no goal
   - Notice your internal state

3. **Comparison (12 min):** Breakout rooms of 3
   - How did each mode feel?
   - Which is more familiar?
   - Which feels more "real"?
   - When do you access being mode?
   - What prevents it?

4. **Synthesis (3 min):** Full group
   - Share insights
   - Discuss Winnicott's claim that being is primary

### Discussion
- Why does modern life emphasize doing over being?
- What's lost when we only "do"?
- How does play restore being?

## Exercise 2: Genuine Aliveness Inventory (30 minutes)

### Concept
Identify when you feel "genuinely alive inside" vs. going through motions

### Activity
1. **Aliveness Mapping (12 min):** Individual, cameras off
   - List activities from a typical week
   - Rate each for "genuine aliveness" (1-10)
     - 10 = Feel most authentically alive
     - 1 = Going through motions, feel dead inside
   - Notice patterns:
     - What scores highest?
     - What scores lowest?
     - How much time in each?

2. **Pattern Sharing (15 min):** Breakout rooms of 3-4
   - Share your highs and lows (if comfortable)
   - Group questions:
     - What activities consistently bring aliveness?
     - What activities consistently deaden?
     - What's the difference between them?
     - How does this relate to Winnicott's theory?
   - Document patterns

3. **Application (3 min):** Full group
   - How much of our lives do we spend genuinely alive?
   - What would it take to increase this percentage?
   - What role does play have?

### Key Insight
Many people spend most of their time in activities that make them feel dead inside

## Exercise 3: The Compliance Trap (30 minutes)

### Concept
Explore how compliance with external demands creates false self and deadens aliveness

### Activity
1. **Compliance Audit (10 min):** Individual reflection
   - Where are you complying rather than being authentic?
     - At work?
     - In relationships?
     - In this Zoom call?
   - What are you performing?
   - What are you hiding?
   - Write privately

2. **Cost-Benefit Analysis (15 min):** Breakout rooms of 3
   - Share one area of compliance (if comfortable)
   - Explore together:
     - What does compliance provide? (safety, approval, belonging)
     - What does it cost? (aliveness, authenticity, self)
     - Is the trade-off worth it?
     - What would change if you were more authentic?
   - Winnicott's framework: False self protects true self but imprisons it

3. **Group Wisdom (5 min):** Full group discussion
   - When is compliance necessary vs. habitual?
   - How to be authentic within necessary constraints?
   - What's the relationship between play and non-compliance?

### Discussion Questions
- Can you be genuinely alive while complying?
- What's the minimum compliance needed?
- How does playfulness resist compliance?

## Exercise 4: Play as Being Practice (25 minutes)

### Concept
Winnicott says play fosters the capacity for being. Practice this.

### Activity

   - Doodle, move, make sounds, whatever emerges
   - Critical: No goal, no product, no improvement
   - Just practice being through play

2. **Reflection (10 min):** Breakout rooms of 3
   - How did that feel?
   - Did you resist purposelessness?
   - What makes purposeless play difficult?
   - How is this different from productive activity?
   - How does this connect to "sense of being"?

3. **Integration (5 min):** Full group
   - What did we learn about being through play?
   - How is play practice for being?
   - What would daily being-practice look like?

### Key Learning

## Facilitator Notes

### Preparation
- Read Wikipedia entry and primary Winnicott if possible
- Reflect on your own being/doing balance
- Consider when you feel most alive vs. most false
- Prepare to hold vulnerable material

### Managing Depth
- This material touches deep existential questions
- Some participants may feel confronted by their inauthenticity
- Hold space without pathologizing
- Emphasize: This is universal human struggle
- Offer hope: Capacity can be recovered

### Zoom Limitations
- Being is harder to access through screens
- Acknowledge this paradox
- Create space for camera-off being
- Use Zoom's limitations to highlight the concepts

### Connection to Reading List
- Builds directly on previous Winnicott piece
- Provides existential depth to Gray's developmental claims
- Connects to phenomenology (what being feels like)
- Links to meaning crisis (without being, no meaning)
- Shows why play matters: It's about aliveness itself
