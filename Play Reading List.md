## The Anthropology of Play
- [ ] [Red Pandas Playing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oimTxlCi36E) [2 minutes]
*Red pandas demonstrate the essence of play.*
- [ ] [What’s the Point If We Can’t Have Fun? - David Graeber](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/whats-the-point-if-we-cant-have-fun) [25 minutes]
*Graeber challenges the dominant view that living beings are driven by rational self-interest, and argues that play is a fundamental principle of reality that can explain the emergence of complexity, consciousness, and freedom. He draws on examples from physics, biology, philosophy, and Taoism to support his claim that play is not a mere anomaly, but a source of joy and creativity that pervades all levels of existence.*
* [Graeber v. Gradgrind - Omniorthogonal](https://omniorthogonal.blogspot.com/2015/12/graeber-v-gradgrind.html) [21 minutes]
*The author argues that Graeber’s view of play as purposeless and opposed to rationality is flawed and anti-scientific. The author also suggests that play can be seen as an emergent phenomenon that does not contradict the logic of evolution or materialism. The author concludes by acknowledging the philosophical challenge of explaining how higher-level phenomena can arise from lower-level mechanisms, but rejects Graeber’s proposal of play as a foundational principle of reality.*
* [On Seriousness: The precious resource America lacks - Katherine Boyle](https://boyle.substack.com/p/on-seriousness) [12 minutes]
*The author argues that Americans have lost their sense of seriousness, which is essential for power and progress. She contrasts the irony and cynicism that dominate American culture with the seriousness of other countries and movements, such as China, ISIS, and South Park. She suggests that seriousness is the maniacal belief in a project greater than oneself, and that it can be found in some pockets of American society, such as immigrants, Miami, and Silicon Valley.*

* [The Ambiguity of Play - Brian Sutton-Smith](https://www.amazon.com/Ambiguity-Play-Brian-Sutton-Smith/dp/0674005813)
*Sutton-Smith focuses on play theories rooted in seven distinct “rhetorics”―the ancient discourses of Fate, Power, Communal Identity, and Frivolity and the modern discourses of Progress, the Imaginary, and the Self. In an analysis that moves from the question of play in child development to the implications of play for the Western work ethic, he explores the values, historical sources, and interests that have dictated the terms and forms of play put forth in each discourse’s “objective” theory.*

## The Role of Play in Developmental Psychology
- [ ] [The Play Deficit - Peter Gray](https://aeon.co/essays/children-today-are-suffering-a-severe-deficit-of-play) [25 minutes]
*Children today are cossetted and pressured in equal measure. Without the freedom to play they will never grow up.*
- [ ] [What Is Play? How Children Define It - Peter Gray](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-learn/202205/what-is-play-how-children-define-it) [9 minutes]
*Many educational programs that claim to be play-based are not really play, because they are controlled by the teacher rather than the children. He also suggests that parents and teachers should do less for children and let them play more freely.*
- [ ] [The Creative Space of Play: D.W. Winnicott - Mike van Eerden](https://onluminousgrounds.wordpress.com/2010/09/19/the-creative-space-of-play/) [7 minutes]
*Explores the concept of playing as the basis for creativity and self-discovery, based on the ideas of British psychologist D.W. Winnicott. The author explains what playing is and is not, and how it enables a creative reaching-out and a triadic relationship with the world (self, samples of inner reality, and pieces of external reality).* 
- [ ] [Donald Winnicott: Play and the sense of being real - Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Winnicott#Play_and_the_sense_of_being_real) [5 minutes]
*One of the elements that Winnicott considered could be lost in childhood was what he called the sense of being – for him, a primary element, of which a sense of doing is only a derivative. The capacity for being – the ability to feel genuinely alive inside, which Winnicott saw as essential to the maintenance of a true self – was fostered in his view by the practice of childhood play.*
- [ ] [Play as a Cognitive Primitive - Mike Travers](http://hyperphor.com/refactor/play-pres/play-lightning-final.html) [7 minutes]
*Play is a fundamental mode of cognition that enables humans to explore, learn, and create. He defines play as a voluntary, self-motivated, and enjoyable activity that is not constrained by external goals or rules. He also discusses the benefits of play for personal development, social interaction, and cultural innovation. He concludes by suggesting that play is a valuable perspective for understanding and designing human-computer systems.*

*Dr. Brown has spent his career studying animal behavior and conducting more than six-thousand "play histories" of humans from all walks of life-from serial murderers to Nobel Prize winners. He explains why play is essential to our social skills, adaptability, intelligence, creativity, ability to problem solve and more. Particularly in tough times, we need to play more than ever, as it's the very means by which we prepare for the unexpected, search out new solutions, and remain optimistic.*

*Argues that life is neither poker nor tennis, but requires a different kind of rationality that he calls metarationality.

- [ ] [Agency Made Me Do It: Play - Mike Travers](http://www.hyperphor.com/ammdi/pages/play.html) [8 minutes]

* [The Grasshopper: Games, Life and Utopia - Bernard Suits](https://www.amazon.com/Grasshopper-Third-Games-Life-Utopia-ebook/dp/B01HQHJ730/)
*In the mid twentieth century the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein famously asserted that games are indefinable; there are no common threads that link them all. “Nonsense,” said the sensible Bernard Suits: “playing a game is a voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.”*

## Playing Games

***Books for Further Reading***
* [Play Unsafe - Graham Walmsley](https://www.amazon.com/Play-Unsafe-Graham-Walmsley-ebook/dp/B009IRMQ7G)
*This book explains how to make roleplaying less like work and more like play: stop killing other players' ideas and build on them instead; and put stories at the heart of your game.*
* [The Aesthetic of Play Hardcover – Brian Upton](https://www.amazon.com/Aesthetic-Play-MIT-Press/dp/0262028514)
*A game designer considers the experience of play, why games have rules, and the relationship of play and narrative. The impulse toward play is very ancient, not only pre-cultural but pre-human; zoologists have identified play behaviors in turtles and in chimpanzees. Games have existed since antiquity; 5,000-year-old board games have been recovered from Egyptian tombs. And yet we still lack a critical language for thinking about play. Game designers are better at answering small questions (“Why is this battle boring?”) than big ones (“What does this game mean?”).*
* [Uncertainty in Games (Playful Thinking) - Greg Costikyan](https://www.amazon.com/Uncertainty-Games-Playful-Thinking-Costikyan-ebook/dp/B08BT2Y39X)
*In life, uncertainty surrounds us. Things that we thought were good for us turn out to be bad for us (and vice versa); people we thought we knew well behave in mysterious ways; the stock market takes a nosedive. Thanks to an inexplicable optimism, most of the time we are fairly cheerful about it all. But we do devote much effort to managing and ameliorating uncertainty.*
