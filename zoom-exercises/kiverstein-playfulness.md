# Zoom Exercise Ideas: Playfulness and the Meaningful Life

**Reference:** [Playfulness and the meaningful life: an active inference perspective - Julian Kiverstein](https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2023/1/niad024/7428705?login=false)
**Topic:** Active inference, uncertainty, and flourishing through play
**Duration:** 25 minutes

## Core Themes
- Active inference models and play
- Uncertainty as conducive to flourishing (under right conditions)
- Playful individuals tolerate and explore uncertainty
- Safe contexts enable uncertainty exploration
- Play as high-level prior that uncertainty is valuable

## Exercise 1: Uncertainty Tolerance (35 minutes)

Explore your relationship to uncertainty

### Activity
1. Uncertainty Inventory (10 min): Where do you face uncertainty?
2. Responses (15 min): Do you avoid or explore?
3. Playful Approach (10 min): What would playful uncertainty-engagement look like?

---

## Exercise 2: Safe-to-Explore Contexts (30 minutes)

Create conditions where uncertainty becomes playful

### Activity
1. Identify Unsafe Contexts (10 min): Where is uncertainty threatening?
2. Design Safe Contexts (15 min): What would make uncertainty playful?
3. Test (5 min): Try playful uncertainty in safe context

---

## Exercise 3: Error as Information (25 minutes)

Practice Kiverstein's framework: errors to explore vs. avoid

### Activity
1. Avoidance Mode (8 min): Errors are bad, minimize them
2. Exploration Mode (8 min): Errors are information, explore them
3. Comparison (9 min): Which led to more learning?

---

## Exercise 4: High-Level Play Prior (30 minutes)

Develop Kiverstein's "high-level prior" that uncertainty is valuable

### Activity
1. Current Prior (10 min): What's your default belief about uncertainty?
2. Play Prior Experiment (15 min): Assume uncertainty is valuable
3. Results (5 min): What changed?

---

## Exercise 5: Flourishing Through Play (30 minutes)

Connect play, uncertainty, and flourishing

### Activity
1. Flourishing Assessment (10 min)
2. Play-Uncertainty Practice Design (15 min)
3. Implementation (5 min)
